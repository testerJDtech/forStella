# forStella

This is a fun git repo for a very awesome sister called Stella Barbosa. 

In this repo, you will find two or three different projects that I've created specifically just for her. This is just a fun way for me to encourage my sister and to make sure she knows that God loves her deeply and so do her brothers and her sisters.

## Project 1
This will simply be a webpage that she can access which will just have a bunch of scriptures that I find she should hold dear to herself. 

Some of these scriptures will include some of her favourite scriptures.

I'm thinking of making six different pages. Each page will be a letter of her name. Each letter (page) will represent a word that I think describes her. 

Then in each page there will be around 5 different scriptures to describe how it's not just me saying those words but God thinks the exact same about her as well.
